# Conversational-Chatbot

The objective of this project is to make use of the latest machine learning techniques to develop an intelligent and engaging chatbot. Using advances in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), the chatbot can be programmed able to understand and reply to user inquiries in a thorough and natural way. A simple conversational chatbot built with TensorFlow and Streamlit. It can respond to user input based on predefined intents from the 'intents.json' file.

### Usage

1. Install required libraries: `pip install streamlit numpy tensorflow nltk`.
2. Run the script: `streamlit run chatbot.py`.

### Features

- The chatbot is trained on predefined intents using a pre-trained model (`model_keras.h5`).
- User inputs are processed and classified to provide relevant responses.

### How to Interact

1. Enter your message in the input box.
2. Receive responses from the chatbot.
3. Conversations are displayed, including both user and bot messages.
